##Welcome to the Documentation for the SITHS Component Library!

The SITHS Component Library is made with Nuxt for usage in a Newspaper style website. The components reflect this and are designed with this in mind. A Newspaper or Magazine website is ideal to use the components to their full potential. We have themes with primary and secondary colors for all buttons - which can be changed by altering the containers class and will trickle down to the entire page.


The Components here were designed by Charlie Baluja, Daniel Briskman, Ethan Liang, Carol Lian, and Alston Chan, Austin.
